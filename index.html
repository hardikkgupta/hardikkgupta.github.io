      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a <s>first-year</s> second-year graduate student at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>. 
        I did my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and master's in Biological Sciences at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS, Pilani</a>. 
        My interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning, Optimization and Neuroscience.</p>
        
      <p>As I transition from Mechanical Engineering to the dynamic world of Computer Science, 
        I have dedicated my last semester to diving deep into this field and enhancing my skills. 
        During this time, I have focused on mastering the foundations and advanced concepts in Computer Science. 
        To flaunt my problem-solving prowess and coding wizardry, I regularly wrestle with coding challenges 
        (and sometimes they wrestle back). Feel free to marvel at my triumphs and trials <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/hardikkgupta/">here</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>I spent my last fall semester working at <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">NUS</a> 
        where I worked in optimization and control of robotic systems for collision avoidance, 
        using Nonlinear model Predictive Control. Apart from this, 
        I have developed NEURON implementations of simulations of dendrites with synapse. 
        With my interest in Biological Sciences, I have also worked on prosthetics for slip detection 
        while grasping at <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/">IIT, Guwahati</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies and would try to workout at the gym. 
        I particularly enjoy biographies and autobiographies. You can check out my reading recommendations 
        and reviews on my Goodreads account given below. When it comes to movies, my favorite genre is 
        thrillers and suspense as I enjoy the excitement and adrenaline that comes with being on the edge of my seat.
